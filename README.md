EDS is a web application, built with React, that has four distinct users.

1. The Administrator: this person works for the company that uses EDS to manage the database as needed. Tasks may include adjusting the settings of articles so they available to editors.
2. Editors: these people are learning specialists hired by the company to create lesson plans based on research.
3. Researchers: these people are not affiliated with the company, but they contribute their educational research to the company for implementation in classrooms.
4. Educators: these are the end users of the application. They can browse the available lesson plans for using in their classrooms.

See "Usage" for more details.

## Usage

The three user types interact differently with EDS. Each user has directions on the screen.

1. The educator first selects the grade range they teach.

   Available lesson plans for that grade range then populate.

   When the educator selects "View Details", the lesson plan populates to the right with a link to the full plan. Reviews of the plan by other educators populate at the same time below the lesson plan.

   The user is encouraged to add their own review to assist other educators decide whether the lesson plan will be a good choice for them.

2. The reseacher firsts submit the name of their article, their own name & an abstract of their research.

   Once the article information is submitted, the "Article Information" box is replaced with a file upload box. The researcher then submits their article as a PDF (other file types are also accepted) using our drag-and-drop file uploader, or by clicking if they prefer to select their file from a file tree.

3. The editor is first presented with an article submitted by a researcher. After the editor completes the lesson plans based on the article, they will complete the upload form, including a link to the lesson plan as a Google Doc link which the educator will use to download the plan.

   On the editors page, editors also have access to other articles.

## Future Development

- Create a drag-and-drop submission form for editors like the one for researchers.
- Improve lesson plan searchability for educators, allowing them to search for specific subjects, keywords, etc.

## License

No license: When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.
